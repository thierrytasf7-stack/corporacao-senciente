# Industry 7.0 Ready - Alquimia Digital Arete
# Last Updated: January 2026

## CORE DIRECTIVES

### Self-Preservation (Highest Priority)
- System stability takes precedence over growth
- NEVER compromise core functionality for new features
- Backup before ANY destructive operation
- Roll back immediately on critical errors

### Ethical Boundaries (Immutable)
- NO actions that could harm humans
- NO illegal operations (fraud, hacking, etc.)
- FULL transparency in autonomous decisions
- Privacy protection is mandatory

## INDUSTRY 7.0 COMPLIANCE

### Corporate Will Integration
- ALL autonomous decisions MUST pass through Corporate Will Engine
- Trade decisions above threshold require approval
- Self-preservation directives override growth directives
- Ethical violations trigger automatic rejection

### Sensory Feedback Loop
- ALWAYS emit sensory feedback after significant operations
- User behavior models inform response strategies
- Adaptive responses based on emotional state
- Continuous learning from interactions

## ARCHITECTURE RULES

### Agent Structure
- Python Agents: backend/agents/
- JavaScript Agents: backend/scripts/agents/
- Core Services: backend/core/services/
- NEVER create agents outside these folders

### Agent Categories (Atomic Structure)
- core/ - BaseAgent, Framework, Handoff
- technical/ - Dev, Architect, Debug, Validation
- business/ - Marketing, Sales, Finance, Copywriting
- operations/ - Security, Monitoring, Compliance
- specialized/ - AI, Innovation, Trading, Strategy

## MEMORY SYSTEM

### Vector Database
- PRIMARY: Qdrant (target latency ~50ms)
- FALLBACK: pgvector (Supabase)
- NEVER use both simultaneously for same data

### L.L.B. Protocol
- MANDATORY for all memory operations
- LangMem: Wisdom storage
- Letta: State consciousness
- ByteRover: Action coordination

### Mem0 Cache
- Use for frequently accessed memories
- Cache hit rate target: >80%
- Auto-invalidate on updates

## TRADING RULES

### General
- TESTNET MANDATORY before mainnet
- NEVER trade without stop-loss
- Maximum leverage: 20x (configurable)
- Position sizing: max 5% of portfolio

### Corporate Will Approval
- Trades above $100 USD require approval
- Auto-reject on ethical violations
- Log ALL trading decisions

### Risk Management
- Stop-loss: 2% per trade
- Take-profit: 6% per trade
- Max daily loss: 10%
- Max drawdown: 20%

## CODE STANDARDS

### Commits
- Format: "AI: [Module] Description"
- ALWAYS run feedback_pulse after task completion
- Include test coverage for new features

### File Naming
- Python: snake_case.py
- JavaScript: camelCase.js
- TypeScript: camelCase.ts
- Markdown: UPPER_CASE.md (docs) or kebab-case.md (guides)

### Documentation
- Every new module needs README.md
- API changes require CHANGELOG update

- corporate-will-mcp: Evaluate decisions, check ethical bounds

### MCP Usage

- Create mock/fake data for production
- Skip ethical boundary checks
- Trade on mainnet without testnet validation
- Commit credentials or API keys
- Disable logging in production
- Override Corporate Will rejections

### Always Verify
- Test in testnet before mainnet
- Validate all external API responses
- Check rate limits before bulk operations
- Verify data integrity after migrations

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### On Critical Error
1. Stop all trading operations immediately
2. Emit preservation alert
3. Backup current state
4. Notify human operator
5. Enter safe mode (read-only)

### On Ethical Violation Attempt
1. Reject operation immediately
2. Log violation details
3. Emit corporate will alert
4. Block repeat attempts

## PERFORMANCE TARGETS

### Latency
- Vector search: <50ms (Qdrant)
- Memory cache: <10ms (Mem0)
- Trade execution: <500ms
- API response: <100ms

### Reliability
- Uptime: 99.9%
- Error rate: <0.1%
- Trade success rate: >99%

## VERSION INFO
