# CORPORAÇÃO SENCIENTE - AGENTIC MEMORY FILE

## STRATEGIC FORECASTING (WHY WE BUILD THIS WAY)

### Tech Evolution Analysis (2026 → 2027+)
- **Frontend:** React Server Components hoje → WebGPU architectures amanhã. Estratégia: Hooks modulares para component swapping.
- **Backend:** FastAPI async hoje → Mojo performance-critical amanhã. Estratégia: ABCs para dependency injection.
- **AI Engine:** MCP orchestration hoje → SSMs nativos amanhã. Estratégia: Strategy pattern para model swapping.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + pgvector hoje → EdgeDB SDL-first amanhã. Estratégia: Repository abstraction layer.

### Pipeline Optimization Matrix (WHAT TO WATCH)
- **High Friction Nodes (70+):** Data ingestion, infrastructure provisioning, L.L.B. storage
- **Medium Friction (40-69):** Signal processing, agent creation, marketing setup
- **Low Friction (<40):** Core business logic, API processing, monitoring

## BUSINESS RULES (IMMUTABLE)

### Holding Operations
- Revenue sharing: 40% holding, 15% reinvestment, 45% subsidiary operations
- Subsidiary creation threshold: 75+ profitability score, 70+ technical feasibility
- Agent autonomy: 95% operations without human intervention

### AI Governance
- L.L.B. protocol: 9 memory types with cross-references
- Meta-learning: Continuous optimization of learning strategies
- Ethical AI: No manipulation of market conditions, transparent operations

### Technical Standards
- Code coverage: Minimum 90%
- Performance: P95 < 500ms for all operations
- Security: Zero-trust architecture, regular penetration testing
- Scalability: Support 1000+ subsidiaries concurrently

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (WHY THIS WAY)

### Modularity Principle
All components use dependency injection via ABCs. This allows:
- Swapping AI engines (GPT → SSMs)
- Changing databases (PostgreSQL → EdgeDB)
- Migrating frontend frameworks (React → SolidJS)
- Without touching business logic

### Future-Proofing Strategy
- **2027 Readiness:** Neuromorphic computing interfaces prepared
- **2028 Vision:** Quantum-resistant cryptography implemented
- **2030+:** Multi-agent swarm orchestration ready
