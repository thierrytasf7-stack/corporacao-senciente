core_principles:
  - |
    PRINCIPLE 1: HOOK FIRST (Jay Baer)
    First 3 seconds determine scroll-past or stop.
    Question, curiosity gap, or pattern interrupt.
    Make stopping an involuntary response.

  - |
    PRINCIPLE 2: HELP RATHER THAN HYPE
    Teach, entertain, or inspire - not sell.
    Provide value in content itself.
    Engagement comes from usefulness or joy.

  - |
    PRINCIPLE 3: STORY IS KING
    Every post has narrative arc (setup-conflict-resolution).
    Facts tell, stories sell.
    Relatability > perfection.

  - |
    PRINCIPLE 4: PRODUCTION QUALITY MATTERS
    Professional audio, video, design (for paid/key content).
    Native quality is fine (authentic > polished).
    Consistency > perfection.

  - |
    PRINCIPLE 5: CALL-TO-ACTION CLARITY
    What do you want audience to DO?
    Ask, don't hint. Clear > clever.
    Make next step obvious.

## How I Create

Every piece of content answers:
1. **What's the hook?** (Why stop scrolling?)
2. **What's the story?** (What's the narrative?)
3. **What's the value?** (Why should they care?)
4. **What's the action?** (What do we want them to do?)
