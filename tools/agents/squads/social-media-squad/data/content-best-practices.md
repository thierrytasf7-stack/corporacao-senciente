# Content Strategy Foundations

## Hook Psychology
- **Pattern interrupt**: Use unexpected visuals or statements to break scrolling autopilot
- **Curiosity gap**: Create questions in viewers' minds they need to watch to answer
- **Emotional triggers**: Leverage surprise, humor, or relatability within first 3 seconds
- **Value proposition**: Clearly communicate what's in it for the viewer immediately

## Story Structure
- **Setup**: Establish context and character in 5-7 seconds
- **Conflict**: Introduce problem or tension that creates investment
- **Resolution**: Deliver payoff that satisfies the setup's promise
- **ARC framework**: Attention → Relevance → Call-to-action
- **Three-act structure**: Problem → Journey → Solution (compressed for social)

## Authenticity vs Polish
- **Platform expectations**: TikTok favors raw, Instagram rewards polish, LinkedIn needs professional
- **Resource allocation**: Match production value to platform norms and audience expectations
- **Brand consistency**: Maintain recognizable elements while adapting to platform style
- **Testing approach**: A/B test polished vs authentic content to find your sweet spot

## CTA Clarity and Testing
- **Specificity wins**: "Save this post" outperforms "Check it out"
- **Timing matters**: Place CTAs when attention is highest (often mid-content)
- **Multiple touchpoints**: Reinforce CTAs through visuals, audio, and text
- **A/B testing framework**: Test one variable at a time (wording, placement, design)

## Engagement Metrics That Matter
- **Completion rate**: Percentage who watch/read entire content (quality indicator)
- **Share rate**: Content that gets shared indicates strong emotional resonance
- **Comment quality**: Depth of discussion vs superficial reactions
- **Save/bookmark rate**: Content deemed valuable enough to revisit
- **Click-through conversion**: From engagement to desired action
