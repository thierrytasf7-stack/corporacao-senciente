# Workflow: Research Then Create Agent

**Workflow ID:** research-then-create-agent
**Version:** 2.0
**Purpose:** Create high-quality agents based on deep research about domain best practices, not generic LLM knowledge
**Orchestrator:** @expansion-creator
**Mode:** YOLO (100% autonomous, no human intervention)
**Quality Standard:** Copy Squad Level (800+ lines, full semantic depth)

---

## Overview

This workflow ensures agents are built on REAL frameworks and methodologies from domain experts, not generic LLM-generated content. The key insight: **agents created without research are weak and generic**.

**v2.0 Changes:**
- Added Quality Gate step (Step 8) with blocking validation
- Uses expansion-agent-tmpl-v2.md template
- Requires all 6 levels: Identity, Operational, Voice DNA, Quality, Credibility, Integration
- Minimum 800 lines per agent

```
INPUT (agent purpose + domain + [specialist])
    ↓
[STEP 1: Parse & Classify]
    → Generic agent OR specialist-based agent?
    ↓
[STEP 2: Check Local Knowledge] ← IF specialist
    → Search: outputs/minds/{slug}/sources/
    → Search: outputs/minds/{slug}/analysis/
    → Search: docs/research/{slug}-*.md
    → Catalog existing resources
    ↓
[STEP 3: Generate Research Prompt]
    → If has local material: "Already have X, need Y"
    → If no local: full research prompt
    ↓
[STEP 4: Execute Deep Research]
    → Combine: Local + WebSearch/API
    ↓
[STEP 5: Consolidate & Validate Research]
    ├─ < 500 lines? → Retry with different queries
    ├─ No primary sources? → Flag for enrichment
    └─ PASS? → Continue
    ↓
[STEP 6: Extract Framework from Research]
    → Principles, processes, checklists
    → Voice DNA (sentence starters, metaphors, vocabulary)
    → Output examples from real sources
    → Anti-patterns from expert warnings
    ↓
[STEP 7: Create Agent Definition]
    → Uses expansion-agent-tmpl.md template
    → MUST include ALL 6 LEVELS:
        Level 1: Identity (agent, persona, metadata)
        Level 2: Operational (frameworks, commands)
        Level 3: Voice DNA (starters, metaphors, vocabulary, states)
        Level 4: Quality (examples, anti-patterns, completion)
        Level 5: Credibility (if applicable)
        Level 6: Integration (handoffs, synergies)
    ↓
[STEP 8: QUALITY GATE] ← NEW IN v2.0
    → Run agent-quality-gate.md checklist
    → BLOCKING requirements must pass:
        ├─ 800+ lines
        ├─ vocabulary.always_use (5+) AND never_use (3+)
        ├─ output_examples (3+)
        ├─ anti_patterns.never_do (5+)
        ├─ completion_criteria defined
        └─ handoff_to defined
    → FAIL? → Loop back to Step 7 with specific fixes
    → PASS? → Continue
    ↓
[STEP 9: Create Agent Tasks]
    → 600+ lines per task
    → Based on extracted framework
    → Include templates, examples, checklists
    ↓
OUTPUT: Agent + Tasks with primary evidence + Quality Gate PASS
```

**Quality Guarantee (v2.0):**
- No agent created without research foundation
- All claims traceable to sources
- Tasks based on REAL processes, not invented ones
- **NEW:** All agents have voice_dna, output_examples, anti_patterns
- **NEW:** All agents have completion_criteria and handoffs
- **NEW:** Minimum 800 lines enforced by Quality Gate

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Parse & Classify Input

**Duration:** < 30 seconds

**Actions:**
```yaml
parse_input:
  - Extract agent_purpose, domain, specialist info
  - Classify agent type:
      generic: No specialist specified
      specialist_based: Has specialist_slug
  - Validate pack_name exists
  - Set output paths
```

**Decision Point:**
```
IF specialist_slug provided:
    → agent_type = "specialist_based"
    → GOTO Step 2 (Check Local Knowledge)
ELSE:
    → agent_type = "generic"
    → GOTO Step 3 (Generate Research Prompt)
```

**Output:**
```yaml
classification:
  agent_type: "specialist_based" | "generic"
  agent_purpose: "Create sales pages"
  domain: "copywriting"
  specialist:
    slug: "gary_halbert"
    name: "Gary Halbert"
  pack_name: "copywriter-os"
  research_output: "docs/research/gary-halbert-sales-page-research.md"
```

---

### Step 2: Check Local Knowledge (IF Specialist)

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Condition:** Only runs if `agent_type == "specialist_based"`

**Actions:**
```yaml
search_local_knowledge:
  primary_sources:
    - path: "outputs/minds/{specialist_slug}/sources/"
      description: "Raw materials, transcripts, books, articles"
      priority: 1

  analysis:
    - path: "outputs/minds/{specialist_slug}/analysis/"
      description: "Identity core, cognitive spec, frameworks"
      priority: 2

    - file: "outputs/minds/gary_halbert/sources/boron-letters.md"
      type: "book_transcript"
      lines: 2450
      relevance: "high"
    - file: "outputs/minds/gary_halbert/sources/coat-of-arms-letter.md"
      type: "sales_letter"
      lines: 180
      relevance: "critical"

  found_research:
    - file: "docs/research/gary-halbert-direct-mail-research.md"
      lines: 890
      topic: "direct mail methodology"

  total_local_lines: 3520
  coverage_assessment: "Strong foundation exists, need sales page specific research"
  gaps_identified:
    - "Sales page structure (vs direct mail letter)"
    - "Digital adaptation of Halbert principles"
    - "Modern case studies"
```

**Output:**
```
📂 Local Knowledge Check for 'gary_halbert':

Found Resources:
  ✅ outputs/minds/gary_halbert/sources/ (12 files, 4,200 lines)
  ✅ outputs/minds/gary_halbert/analysis/identity-core.yaml
  ✅ docs/research/gary-halbert-direct-mail-research.md (890 lines)

Coverage: 70% (strong foundation)
Gaps: Sales page specific structure, digital adaptation

→ Research prompt will focus on GAPS only
```

### Step 3: Generate Research Prompt

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Reference:** `templates/research-prompt-tmpl.md`

**Actions:**
```yaml
generate_prompt:
  - Load research prompt template
  - Fill sections based on:
      agent_purpose: What we're building
      domain: Area of expertise
      specialist: If applicable
      local_knowledge: What we already have (from Step 2)
      gaps: What we still need

  - Generate 7-component research prompt:
      1. REFINED_TOPIC: Strategic title expanding scope
      2. CONTEXT: Purpose and practical objectives
      3. SCOPE: 4-6 specific angles to investigate
      4. REQUIREMENTS: 3-4 parameters for research
      5. RECOMMENDED_SOURCES: 3-4 specific source types
      6. EXPECTED_RESULTS: 3-5 concrete deliverables
      7. CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS: 2-3 questions to refine
```

**Prompt Adaptation Logic:**
```python
if local_knowledge.total_lines > 1000:
    # Has substantial local knowledge
    prompt_mode = "complementary"
    prompt_focus = local_knowledge.gaps_identified
    prompt_note = f"NOTE: Already have {local_knowledge.total_lines} lines of material. Focus research on GAPS: {gaps}"
else:
    # Little or no local knowledge
    prompt_mode = "comprehensive"
    prompt_focus = "full_framework"
    prompt_note = "No existing material. Conduct comprehensive research."
```

**Output Example (Specialist-Based):**
```markdown
# Deep Research Prompt: Gary Halbert Sales Page Methodology

## REFINED TOPIC
"The Sales Page Engineering of Gary Halbert: Complete Anatomy of Direct Mail Letters
that Generated Millions — From Envelope to PS, Adapted for Digital (1970-2007)"

### Step 6: Extract Framework from Research

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

**Extraction Process:**
```yaml
framework_extraction:

  extract_components:

    principles:
      instruction: "Extract explicit rules/principles stated by the expert"
      format: "Bullet list with source citation"
      example:
        - "Never start with 'Dear Friend' - Halbert, Boron Letters Ch.12"
        - "First sentence must grab by the throat - Halbert, Seminar 1986"

    process:
      instruction: "Extract step-by-step process the expert uses"
      format: "Numbered workflow"
      example:
        1. "Research target deeply before writing"
        2. "Write headline last, not first"
        3. "Read aloud to check rhythm"

    structure:
      instruction: "Extract structural anatomy of the output"
      format: "Template with sections"
      example:
        - "Section: Headline - Purpose: Stop and hook"
        - "Section: Lead - Purpose: Build curiosity"
        - "Section: Body - Purpose: Build argument"

    quality_criteria:
      instruction: "Extract what expert considers good vs bad"
      format: "Do/Don't list"
      example:
        do: "Use specific numbers"
        dont: "Use vague claims"

    checklist:
      instruction: "Derive validation checklist from expert criteria"
      format: "Checkbox list"
```

**Output:**
```yaml
extracted_framework:

  name: "Halbert Sales Letter Framework"
  source: "docs/research/gary-halbert-sales-page-research.md"

  principles:
    - "The most important thing is the LIST, then the OFFER, then the COPY"
    - "A-Pile letters look like personal mail, not advertising"
    - "Every sentence must compel reading the next"
    - "Specificity is more believable than generality"
    - "The PS is the second most-read part after the headline"

  process:
    1. "Define your starving crowd (who desperately wants this)"
    2. "Research until you know them better than they know themselves"
    3. "Write the offer before the copy"
    4. "Draft headline options (20-50 before choosing)"
    5. "Write the lead (first 3 paragraphs)"
    6. "Build body with proof stacking"
    7. "Craft irresistible guarantee"
    8. "Write PS that restates main benefit + urgency"
    9. "Read aloud and cut ruthlessly"

  structure:
    - section: "Envelope/Subject"
      purpose: "Get opened, look personal"
      halbert_rule: "Hand-addressed or typed, never labels"

    - section: "Headline"
      purpose: "Stop reader, promise benefit"
      halbert_rule: "News + benefit + curiosity"

    - section: "Lead (3 paragraphs)"
      purpose: "Hook and qualify"
      halbert_rule: "Start with reader, not you"

    - section: "Body"
      purpose: "Build desire through proof"
      halbert_rule: "Stack proof: story → facts → testimonials"

    - section: "Offer"
      purpose: "Make irresistible"
      halbert_rule: "Value must be 10x price perceived"

    - section: "Guarantee"
      purpose: "Remove risk"
      halbert_rule: "Make it specific and bold"

    - section: "CTA"
      purpose: "Get action NOW"
      halbert_rule: "Urgency must be real"

    - section: "PS"
      purpose: "Restate + urgency"
      halbert_rule: "Second most read - use wisely"

  quality_criteria:
    excellent:
      - "Opens like personal letter from friend"
      - "Specific numbers and proof throughout"
      - "Reads smoothly aloud"
      - "Each paragraph earns the next"

    weak:
      - "Looks like advertising"
      - "Vague claims without proof"
      - "Starts talking about seller"
      - "No clear urgency"

  checklist:
    - "[ ] Does it pass A-Pile test? (looks personal)"
    - "[ ] Does headline promise specific benefit?"
    - "[ ] Does lead hook in first 3 sentences?"
    - "[ ] Is proof stacked (story → facts → testimonials)?"
    - "[ ] Is guarantee bold and specific?"
    - "[ ] Is urgency real, not manufactured?"
    - "[ ] Does PS restate main benefit?"
    - "[ ] Does it read smoothly aloud?"
```

## Error Handling

### Research Failures

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| No local knowledge found | Mind doesn't exist | Continue with web-only research |
| WebSearch rate limit | Too many queries | Backoff and retry |
| < 500 lines after research | Insufficient sources | Retry with broader queries (max 2) |
| No primary sources | Only secondary content | Flag warning, continue |

### Validation Failures

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Research too thin | Niche topic | Accept CONDITIONAL, document gaps |
| No actionable framework | Theory-only sources | Retry with "process" "how-to" queries |
| Quality < 60% | Poor research | STOP, return to user |

### Agent Creation Failures

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Agent ID exists | Duplicate | Prompt for new name or update existing |
| Task < 600 lines | Insufficient research | Add more detail from sources |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Specialist-Based Agent (CopywriterOS)

```bash
@expansion-creator
*workflow research-then-create-agent \
  --agent-purpose "Create high-converting sales pages" \
  --domain "copywriting" \
  --specialist-slug "gary_halbert" \
  --specialist-name "Gary Halbert" \
  --pack-name "copywriter-os"
```

### Example 2: Generic Domain Agent

```bash
@expansion-creator
*workflow research-then-create-agent \
  --agent-purpose "Conduct user interviews for product discovery" \
  --domain "product-management" \
  --pack-name "product-os"
```

### Example 3: Multiple Specialists (Blended)

```bash
@expansion-creator
*workflow research-then-create-agent \
  --agent-purpose "Create VSL scripts" \
  --domain "copywriting" \
  --specialist-slug "jon_benson" \
  --specialist-name "Jon Benson" \
  --secondary-specialists "eugene_schwartz,gary_halbert" \
  --pack-name "copywriter-os"
```

## Integration Points

**Upstream (provides input):**
- User request for new agent
- Existing minds in `outputs/minds/`
- Existing research in `docs/research/`

**Downstream (consumes output):**
- `create-expansion-agent.md` task (Step 7)
- `create-expansion-task.md` task (Step 8)
- Agent activation system

**Lateral (parallel workflows):**
- `workflows/upgrade-agent-with-research.md` - For existing weak agents
- `workflows/bulk-research-agents.md` - Multiple agents at once

---

## Quality Guarantees

This workflow enforces:

1. **Research First** - No agent without research foundation
2. **Primary Sources** - Prioritize expert's own words
3. **Local Knowledge** - Use existing MMOS resources first
4. **Traceability** - All claims linked to sources
5. **Minimum Depth** - 500+ lines research, 600+ lines tasks
6. **Expert Methodology** - Real processes, not LLM invention
7. **Quality Gates** - Validation at each step

**Anti-Pattern Prevented:**
```
❌ OLD WAY (CopywriterOS problem):
   User: "Create copywriter agent"
   LLM: *invents generic copywriting advice*
   Result: Weak, generic agent

✅ NEW WAY (This workflow):
   User: "Create copywriter agent based on Gary Halbert"
   Workflow: *researches Halbert's REAL methodology*
   Result: Agent with authentic, traceable expertise
```
